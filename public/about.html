<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I graduate from the University of Maryland College Park with a B.S. in Finance and Information Systems in 2015. 
I've been employed by Amcor (previously Berry Global) since 2016. Amcor has locations all over the world but 
I am based in Baltimore, MD where I am the plant's Inventory Coordinator. I focus on our sustainability efforts, reducing and reusing the plant's plastic 
by products. My mission is to spearhead initiatives that will allow us to reduce cost </p>
